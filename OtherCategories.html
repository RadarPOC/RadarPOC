<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>MAINSTREAM</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in NHSD production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>CANDIDATE</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact.</li>
<li><strong>CONTAIN</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are used in some way in our environment. Generally for legacy applications and services; technologies that we are looking to deprecate in next couple fo years; New projects should not use these technologies </li>
<li><strong>DEPRECATE</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
</ul>

</td><td>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams at NHSD to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. 
Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and consider using in their projects.
</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by the <em>TRG and AIDA</em> &mdash; an open group of  senior NHSD technologists committed to devote time to the Tech Radar purpose. The team self organises to maintain the Tech Radar documents, including this public version. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on in guild meetings. The Tech Radar depends on active participation and input from all engineering teams at NHSD.
