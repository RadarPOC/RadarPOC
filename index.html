<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>MAINSTREAM</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>PROPOSED</strong> &mdash; Technologies that can be explored in new projects, but must be agreed as MAINSTREAM before going to production.</li>
<li><strong>CONTAIN</strong> &mdash; Technologies that should not be used for new projects, but don't actively need to be removed from existing products.</li>
<li><strong>AVOID</strong> &mdash; Technologies that should not be used for new projects, and should be actively removed from existing products.</li>
</ul>
