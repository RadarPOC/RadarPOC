        <h3>What do the rings mean?</h3>
        <p>The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
            assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MAINSTREAM</strong> &mdash; Technologies that can be used in new projects and existing projects.</li>
          <li><strong>PROPOSED</strong> &mdash; Technologies that can be explored in new projects, but must be agreed as
            MAINSTREAM before going to production.</li>
          <li><strong>CONTAIN</strong> &mdash; Technologies that should not be used in new projects, but don't actively
            need to be removed from existing products.</li>
          <li><strong>AVOID</strong> &mdash; Technologies that should not be used in new projects, and should actively
            be removed from existing products.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What do the quadrants mean?</h3>
        <p>The Engineering Tech Radar is for technologies which we use to construct and operate products, as opposed to 
          technologies that make up those products themselves (that's the Application Tech Radar). We classify the 
          Engineering technologies via these four quadrants:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>BUILD TOOLS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to build the product artefacts, including
            code repositories, CI/CD tools, build/packaging tools, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>OBSERVABILITY</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to observe operational products, e.g. 
            log aggregation, monitoring, and alerting.</li>
          <li><strong>TEST TOOLS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to test running software (both functional
            and non-functional testing, e.g. resilience testing.</li>
          <li><strong>CODE ANALYSIS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use for the various types of static-code 
            analysis (e.g. checking code hygiene, checking for security hotspots, scanning code for secrets, etc.</li>
        </ul>
