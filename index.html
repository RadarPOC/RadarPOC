        <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
        <p>The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, organised into groups (or "quadrants") and complemented by an
          assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We have two radars:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#" onclick="load_radar(radarEngineeringData);"><strong>ENGINEERING RADAR</strong></a> &mdash;
            Technologies we use to construct and operate products: if these technologies fail, our products will not
            be directly impacted, but we as a team will be impacted. Examples include: test tools, monitoring tools,
            etc.</li>
          <li><a href="#" onclick="load_radar(radarApplicationData);"><strong>APPLICATION RADAR</strong></a> &mdash;
            Technologies that directly make up those products: if these technologies fail, our products fail / are
            directly impacted. Examples include: programming languages, database technologies, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <h3>What do the rings mean?</h3>
        <p>We use four rings with the following semantics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MAINSTREAM</strong> &mdash; Technologies that can be used in new projects and existing projects.</li>
          <li><strong>PROPOSED</strong> &mdash; Technologies that can be explored in new projects, but must be agreed as
            MAINSTREAM before going to production.</li>
          <li><strong>CONTAIN</strong> &mdash; Technologies that must not be used in new projects, but don't actively
            need to be removed from existing products.</li>
          <li><strong>AVOID</strong> &mdash; Technologies that must not be used in new projects, and should actively
            be removed from existing products.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <h3>What do the quadrants mean?</h3>
        <div id="Engineering-Quadrants-List">
          <p>We classify Engineering technologies via these four quadrants:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>BUILD TOOLS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to build the product artefacts, including
              code repositories, CI/CD tools, build/packaging tools, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>OBSERVABILITY</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to observe operational products, e.g.
              log aggregation, monitoring, and alerting.</li>
            <li><strong>TEST TOOLS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to test running software, both functional
              and non-functional testing (e.g. resilience testing).</li>
            <li><strong>CODE ANALYSIS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use for static-code analysis, including
              code hygiene, security hotspots, scanning code for secrets, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="Application-Quadrants-List">
          <p>We classify Application technologies via these four quadrants:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>LANGUAGES</strong> &mdash; Scripting and application-development languages, including scripting
              for infrastrcuture .</li>
            <li><strong>PERSISTENCE</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to store data / state, e.g. databases,
              file systems, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>PLATFORM TOOLS</strong> &mdash; Technologies on which we run software, e.g. operating systems
              and compute services.</li>
