    <tr>
      <td><p>The Engineering Tech Radar is for technologies which we use to construct and operate products, as opposed to 
          technologies that make up the products themselves (that's the Application Tech Radar).</p></td>

        <h3>What do the rings mean?</h3>
        <p>The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
            assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MAINSTREAM</strong> &mdash; Technologies that can be used in new projects and existing projects.</li>
          <li><strong>PROPOSED</strong> &mdash; Technologies that can be explored in new projects, but must be agreed as
            MAINSTREAM before going to production.</li>
          <li><strong>CONTAIN</strong> &mdash; Technologies that should not be used in new projects, but don't actively
            need to be removed from existing products.</li>
          <li><strong>AVOID</strong> &mdash; Technologies that should not be used in new projects, and should actively
            be removed from existing products.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <h3>What do the quadrants mean?</h3>
        <p>We classify Engineering technologies via these four quadrants:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>BUILD TOOLS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to build the product artefacts, including
            code repositories, CI/CD tools, build/packaging tools, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>OBSERVABILITY</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to observe operational products, e.g. 
            log aggregation, monitoring, and alerting.</li>
          <li><strong>TEST TOOLS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use to test running software, both functional
            and non-functional testing (e.g. resilience testing).</li>
          <li><strong>CODE ANALYSIS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we use for static-code analysis, including 
            code hygiene, security hotspots, scanning code for secrets, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
