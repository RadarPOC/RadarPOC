<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>MAINSTREAM</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>CANDIDATE</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact.</li>
<li><strong>CONTAIN</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are used in some way in our environment. Generally for legacy applications and services; technologies that we are looking to deprecate in next couple fo years; New projects should not use these technologies </li>
<li><strong>DEPRECATE</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
</ul>
